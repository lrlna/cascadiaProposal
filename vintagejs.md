## The story you'd like to tell

JavaScript. 20 years. The tale of adventure, creation, and infinite drama. This talk will walk you through the highlights of the last 20 years of JS development: the good, the bad, and the ugly. I want to explore the strangeness, the beauty, and the occasional nonsense of this wonderful language over the years. As part of preparation for the talk I want to interview various people with javascript experience over the past two decades; as well as doing research on the actual variations of the code. I am talking everything from dreamweaver, the frameworks explosion, node.js, and the list goes on.

## Speaker Bio

![](avatar url)

Hey-o! I am a junior dev with 6(going on 7!) months of experience. Being a still in that honey moon stage with my code allows to be pretty much excited about every aspect of code. Exploring galore; possibilities - endless; infinite opportunities. Outside of code(what?!?, there is an outside of code?) I explore music, art and culture within the community I live in. Literature is quite interesting too.
