## The story you'd like to tell

JavaScript. 20 years. The tale of adventure, creation, and infinite drama. This talk will walk you through the highlights of the last 20 years of JS development: the good, the bad, and the ugly. I want to explore the strangeness, the beauty, and the occasional nonsense of this wonderful language over the years. I don't want to focus on its historical facts(hello wikipedia), but rather the programmatical development and people's experiences with it. As part of preparation for the talk I want to interview various people with javascript experience over the past two decades; as well as doing research on the actual variations of the code. I am talking everything from dreamweaver, the frameworks explosion, node.js, and the list goes on.
