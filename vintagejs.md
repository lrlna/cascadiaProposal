## The story you'd like to tell

JavaScript. 20 years. The tale of adventure, creation, and infinite drama.
 
Yes, I am a junior, looking to speak about the history of something that's been around for pretty much as long as myself.

Why? I want to see this from a persepective of a n00b, looking backward into the unknown. That perspective is bound to vary. Rather than reminiscing about the past, I want to look at the good, the bad, the ugly, and the whimsical exactly the way it looks at this point in time. I want to explore the strangeness, the beauty, and the occasional nonsense of this wonderful language over the years.

A outline will include, but is not limited to:

* a brief illustrated(or shall I say animated?) history of JS;
*	JS then and now. eg. dreamweaver and server side js;  
* results from interviews with those who have developed JS over the past two decades to help me get a different perspective;
