## The story you'd like to tell

JavaScript. 20 years. The tale of adventure, creation, and infinite drama. This talk will walk you through the highlights of the last 20 years of JS development: the good, the bad, and the ugly. I want to explore the strangeness, the beauty, and the occasional nonsense of this wonderful language over the years. I don't want to focus on its historical facts(hello wikipedia), but rather the programmatical development and people's experiences with it.

questions to answer from people's feedback:
	* what shaould the main focus be? --> not history, probably development over the years, all the wimsical nonsense people were doing.
	* WHY should a junior do this presentation?? --> there are sooo many people who actually have lived through all the time, why should you be the one to talk about 20 years of js?
	* more confident bio.
