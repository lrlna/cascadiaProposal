## The story you'd like to tell

JavaScript. 20 years. The tale of adventure, creation, and infinite drama.
 
Yes, I am a junior, looking to speak about the history of something that's been around for pretty much as long as myself.

Why? I want to see this from a persepective of a n00b, looking backward into the unknown. That perspective is bound to vary. Rather than reminiscing about the past, I want to look at the good, the bad, the ugly, and the wimsical exactly the way it looks at this point in time. I want to explore the strangeness, the beauty, and the occasional nonsense of this wonderful language. History is important in my aspects of our lives in general, and I think it's the same when it comes to programming. We should know what roots we come from and how we as a JavaScript community have grown and learnt.

Irina Shestak: investigates the ancient runes of Javascript when sheâ€™s not busy being a secret agent. Daily contemplates art, music, intricacies of code and culture. 
Coding for less than a year, Irina has chosen this path for probably the nerdiest out there - to work more closely with data. Her first job as a developer is in JavaScript and she (with some trials and tribulations) instantly fell in love with the language.
