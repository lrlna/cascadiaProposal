## The story you'd like to tell

JavaScript. 20 years. The tale of adventure, creation, and infinite drama. This talk will walk you through the highlights of the last 20 years of JS development: the good, the bad, and the ugly. I want to explore the strangeness, the beauty, and the occasional nonsense of this wonderful language over the years.
